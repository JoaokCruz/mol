# My Own Language (MOL)
> A learning project to understand language design and interpreters

## Overview
This project implements a custom programming language using Python. It serves as an educational exploration into language design, parsing, and interpreter implementation. The choice of Python as the implementation language was deliberate to focus on the concepts rather than low-level implementation details.

## Purpose
The main goals of this project are:
- Understanding how programming languages work under the hood
- Learning about lexical analysis and parsing
- Exploring interpreter design patterns
- Gaining hands-on experience with language implementation concepts

## Why Python?
Python was chosen as the implementation language for several reasons:
- Clear and readable syntax that makes the concepts easier to understand
- Rich standard library that simplifies text processing and parsing
- Focus on the language design concepts rather than memory management
- Excellent for prototyping and iterative development

I know creating a interpreted languange on a interpreted language but this is just for fun


It ain't much but it's honest work
